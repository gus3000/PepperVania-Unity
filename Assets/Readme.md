## Ideas

no sword, only dash and bite
-> to expand on that, maybe every time you find a weapon, Pepper discards it and finds something else in the packaging ?

Boss : Theobulle
Old wise man giving you an item : Popeye

## Abilities
- probably
  - dash augments
    - rock smasher (instead of rocks, fragile decoration objects)
    - Ori-style dash through lights
  - wall climb (maybe not cause I'll have to implement different altitudes...) (curtains ?)
  - pass through tiny holes (or pipes ?)
  - swat at things (birds, switches, etc)
- maybe
  - Jump (long jump, dash jump, double jump...)

## Environment
- light switches ?
- things to climb on

Goal : fetch the wire of destiny

Would be nice :
- birds that fly away (insulting you)
- fairy giving you a single tip before being swatted at by Pepper and flying away
