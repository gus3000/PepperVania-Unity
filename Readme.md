# PepperVania

an isometric micro-MetroidVania

## Ideas

no sword, only dash and bite
 -> to expand on that, maybe every time you find a weapon, Pepper discards it and finds something else in the packaging ?

Boss : Theobulle
Old wise man giving you an item : Popeye

Types of abilities unlocking areas in iso :
- rock smasher = dash augment (instead of rocks, fragile decoration objects)
- wall climb (maybe not cause I'll have to implement different altitudes...) (curtains ?)
- pass through tiny holes
- Jump (long jump, dash jump, double jump...)

Goal : fetch the wire of destiny

Would be nice :
- birds that fly away (insulting you)
- fairy giving you a single tip before being swatted at by Pepper and flying away
